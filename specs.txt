Real-Time Communication:

Messages should be delivered in real-time between users. 

New messages should automatically appear in the chat interface without requiring a page refresh.



Documentation:

Comprehensive documentation should be provided for installation, configuration, and usage of the application for developers and administrators 



User Search and Conversation Creation:

Users should be able to search for other users by their unique name.

Upon finding the desired user, the current user should be able to initiate a conversation with them.

The application should support the creation of new conversations between users based on the search results.

Main Points

store the sockets data somewhere else to make sure if the server restarts, the data doesn't get lost. But still the app should be efficient enough. 

dockerize the app, create a container for the database as well and store its data in a volume. make sure to write instructions to backup the data.


Technologies to be used:



Frontend: NextJS with TypeScript

Chose right stack for this sort of Application for backend and database



Make sure your code is clean and record a video of the loom.

Looking forward to your prompt response and the timely submission of the task. Thank you.
